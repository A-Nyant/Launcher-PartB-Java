# Launcher-PartB-Java
Here is a summary of the project.

This was part one of a two part project. For part A, we worked alone. For part B, we worked with a partner.

For version b, we had some instructions

We had a lot of class. I will break down what each class does.

For the target class, the target moves up and down. However, it has a feature where it will randomly (2% probability) move in a different direction.

For the launcherB, we added so that it will only launch the bullet in the launcher zone. (See previous Launcher-PartA-Java Project to understand more.

The Launcher zone created the zone and was used to update the scores.

For the bullet, we changed the color of the bullet and added a second bullet. This class was used to detect if the bullet hit the target. If it did, then it will update the scores and call the Resizableball class.

For Resizableball class, It was a previous project that I worked on. I changed it so that it would be the graphics when the bullet hits the target.

Other information,

We showed how many group shots were fired, how many targets were hit and the hit rate n the screen.
